/*Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
>> There are two ways to solve this problem- one is by using *(unordered map) and another one is by using *(XOR operation).
>>Key Idea:
We use the XOR ( ^ ) operator, which has two important properties:
~ x ^ x = 0 (Any number XORed with itself is 0)
~ x ^ 0 = x (Any number XORed with 0 remains unchanged)
XOR is commutative and associative, meaning order doesnâ€™t matter.
ðŸ”¹ Why does this work?
Since every number appears twice except for one, XORing all elements will cancel out the duplicate numbers (x ^ x = 0),
 leaving only the unique number.
